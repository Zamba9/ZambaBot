# STAGE 1 — Greet n Meet in the first week

Main goals:
Get to know your teammates
* Have first meeting. In the meeting, define the requirements, reverse-engineer features and list them, choose tech-stack and tools. It’s also okay to finish this meeting with the features set but not sure what/how to make the project happen. We’re here to learn so that’s perfectly fine.
* Pick team name. Have fun with this. Past names include: The General Meerkats, The Sundials, The Eukats, The-Gang-of-Four-Lions, VEJATHER, among others.
* Someone or a pair work together to create a github repo. It doesn’t have to have any code, but please add README of some kind. The point is to get the foundation put down in the first week.

Soft due-date before 26th of March .

# TAGE 2 — Learn/Build
Main goal:
Help each other learn git.
The team should start coding out the features/ tasks set out prior.
Communication is key. If you’re going to be away for a long stretch, let your team know. If you are confused about something, let the team know. If you have an idea, let the team know. :)
Tip:
* Pair programming is one of the fastest ways to help others learn anything.
* Pair programming is also one of the best ways to tackle tasks/ features.

# STAGE 3 — Learn/Build some more
**Main goal**:
Continue to learn/ hack away until the requirements are finished.
Project is finished when the live version/ github has been shared in the cohort.
Soft due-date: 3–4 weeks.
Tip:
*— Be weary of losing momentum. This is the most dangerous thing for a team, and if you see a loss of momentum coming, do whatever you can to keep the fire alive!

# Part B — Pivot — Create your own idea for a bot and build a splash page
By now the team should have enough structure and experience to be able to set the stages. :)
Main goal: Plan a pivot project that the team can call their own. It can have similar functionalities to what you reverse engineered.
